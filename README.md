# ONE exporter

Prometheus exporter for OpenNebula clusters, written in Go. The exporter exposes the metrics of the hosts in a cluster, through the GOCA API of the OpenNebula Frontend. The metrics are provided both per host and summed per cluster to give you a quick overview of your OpenNebula cluster as a whole. While the cluster metrics aren't strictly necessary as they can be calculated using the host metrics, they are added for convenience.


## Use

You can run the one exporter with the `-c` flag pointing to its configuration file. If you don't include a configuration file, the exporter will use the config.yml in the current directory, so `./one_exporter` and `./one_exporter -c config.yml` are identical.

Use the `--help` flag for more information.

## Grafana

In the folder `grafana` you find json descriptions to show the exported data in a grafana dashboard
